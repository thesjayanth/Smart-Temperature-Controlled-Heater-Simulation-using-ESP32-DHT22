# upliance.ai – Embedded Systems Intern Assignment

## 🔧 Project Overview
This project implements a heater control system using an ESP32 board and DHT22 sensor. The system simulates heater behavior with state transitions and alerts using an LED and buzzer.

## 💡 System Features
- Temperature sensing using DHT22
- Heater control using an LED
- Buzzer alerts in overheat condition
- State-based logic with 5 states:
  - IDLE
  - HEATING
  - STABILIZING
  - TARGET REACHED
  - OVERHEAT
- Serial monitor logging for debugging

## 🛠️ Components Used
- ESP32 Dev Board
- DHT22 Temperature Sensor
- LED (simulating heater)
- Buzzer (for overheat alert)
